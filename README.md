# PREDICTS: Portable Real-time Soil Nutrient Detection and Intelligent Crop Treatment System

An undergraduate thesis project for the **Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering** at Samar State University.  
PREDICTS is a portable device designed to detect real-time soil nutrient levels and provide fertilizer recommendations for precision farming.  
The project aligns with **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**, aiming to optimize fertilizer usage and support sustainable agriculture.

## Features
- Real-time detection of primary soil nutrients: **Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)**.
- Soil moisture and temperature monitoring.
- Fertilizer recommendation system based on **Soil Test Crop Response (STCR)** method.
- Portable and user-friendly device with LCD display for results.
- Tested and validated with rice crop soil in Samar Province, Philippines.

## Technologies & Components
- **Hardware:** ESP32 Microcontroller, NPK Sensor, Soil Moisture & Temperature Sensor, 20x4 LCD Display, Li-ion Battery.
- **Software:** Arduino IDE (embedded C/C++).
- **Methodology:** Experimental Developmental Design using the Prototyping Model.
- **Evaluation:** ISO/IEC 25010:2011 (Functionality, Performance, Usability, Reliability, Portability).

## Objectives
1. Measure and display soil nutrients in real-time.
2. Provide intelligent crop treatment recommendations by suggesting appropriate fertilizer dosages.
3. Evaluate the system through ISO/IEC 25010:2011-based survey for quality assurance.

## Results
- Field tests showed accurate nutrient measurement and reliable fertilizer recommendations.
- Farmer feedback rated the system as **satisfactory** in terms of functionality, efficiency, and usability.
- Demonstrated potential for improving crop yield and reducing excessive fertilizer use.

## Significance
- Helps farmers optimize fertilizer usage, reduce costs, and improve yields.
- Contributes to food security and sustainable agricultural practices.
- Reduces environmental impacts of over-fertilization such as soil degradation and water pollution.
